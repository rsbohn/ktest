This is a testbed for Kynetx scripts. It provides an on-demand testbed for any Kynetx ruleset.

To use it: 
-First figure out your ruleset ID, for example a421x47.
-Add a rule that will fire for your rulset
      select when pageview "ktest.heroku.com/a421x47"
-Next open http://ktest.heroku.com/a421x47
-When the page loads your ruleset is automatically included in the page
(using site tags)
-Your rule fires, doing whatever is should do.

Why not just use a bookmarklet?
With a bookmarklet you wind up refreshing the page, then running the
bookmarklet. Why not just press 'F5'?

Why not use Waahui?
You should use Waahui (www.waahui.com) - it is a great place to build
a UI for your Kynetx applications. ktest.heroku.com is more about testing
and trying stuff out.
